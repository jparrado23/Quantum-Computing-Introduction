# Quantum Computing Introduction

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate and explain various quantum computing algorithms. The goal is to provide educational resources that showcase different quantum algorithms with clear explanations, working implementations, and visualizations.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository is to help learners understand quantum computing concepts through:
- **Interactive notebooks**: Hands-on implementations using Qiskit
- **Clear explanations**: Detailed descriptions of quantum algorithms and protocols
- **Practical examples**: Working code that can be executed and modified
- **Visualizations**: Circuit diagrams and measurement results

## Contents

Each notebook focuses on a specific quantum computing algorithm or protocol, providing:
- Theoretical background and motivation
- Step-by-step implementation
- Simulation results and analysis
- Real-world applications and extensions

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you'll need:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Qiskit and related quantum computing libraries
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
